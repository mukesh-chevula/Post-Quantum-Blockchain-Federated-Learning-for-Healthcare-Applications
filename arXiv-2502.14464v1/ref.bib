In addition, the recipient of signed data can use a digital signature as evidence in demonstrating to a third party that the signature was, in fact, generated by the claimed signatory. This is known as non-repudiation since the signatory cannot easily repudiate the signature at a later time. SLH-DSA is based on SPHINCS+, which was selected for standardization as part of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization process.},
